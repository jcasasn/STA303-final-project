# Analyzing the fairness of a companyâ€™s hiring and remuneration processes

Last semester I took a course called Methods of Data Analysis. Our final project for the course was a consulting project for Black Saber Software, a made-up company whose data was based on real research and employment trends. We were tasked with forming an imaginary consulting group with other classmates, analyzing their hiring and employee data and creating a report appropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion.
